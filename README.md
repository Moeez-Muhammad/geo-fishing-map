# geo-fishing-map
A map of licensed fisheries in Atlantic Canada for a geography assignment

I hate ArcGIS Online honestly, so I made this just to spite that stupid piece of software.

Data:  
  Province shape files: Canadian Government  
  Fishery information: Canadian Government  
  Other useless information is .csv file: That horrible piece of software ArcGIS Online  

Dependencies:
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Geopandas

Thanks to Benjamin Cooley from Towards Data Science for his tutorial (https://towardsdatascience.com/lets-make-a-map-using-geopandas-pandas-and-matplotlib-to-make-a-chloropleth-map-dddc31c1983d)  
All code is taken from that tutorial, so I extend a grateful thanks for helping me spite that piece of crap software
